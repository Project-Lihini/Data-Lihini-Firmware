Project Lihini is a project aiming towards building an opensource, end to end weather monitoring platform. The aim is to build a weather monitoring platform that sources data from volunteers and makes the data available publicly. Everything from hardware to software is intended to be opensource. This includes the hardware designs, firmware and web front-end and back-end.

This repo holds the firmware of Data Lihini, the monitoring device that monitors, process and send data to the platform. The platform is based around the [ESP8266 microcontroller](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266) with [FreeRTOS](https://freertos.org/) as the platform. Development is done in [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) along with VS Code as the IDE. This allows the project to harness the real-time capabilities of the FreeRTOS along with the wifi compatibility of the ESP8266.
